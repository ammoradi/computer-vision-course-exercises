What the program does?
-----------------------
* read input video `input.avi`.
* uses built-in openCv methods for [reading and writing video](https://www.learnopencv.com/read-write-and-display-a-video-using-opencv-cpp-python/).
* uses built-in openCv methods for [kalman filter prediction and correction](http://answers.opencv.org/question/82128/kalman-filter-with-haar-face-detection/).
* show and save output video containing face detection and kalman filter correction.

How to run?
-----------
* run app.py file by following command: `$ python3.6 app.py`
